        ALTHEA THURSTON</h5>
<h4>POOR MAN</h4>. <p>[_Indicating the_ JUDGE _with a motion of his head_.]</p> <p>Is that him?</p>

<h4>IMP</h4>. <p>[_Whispering loudly his reply._]</p> <p>Yes, that is his honor.</p>

<h4>POOR MAN.</h4> <p>[_Still whispering and showing signs of nervousness._]</p> <p>Do I dare speak to him?</p>

<h4>IMP</h4>. <p>[_Enjoying the situation and still whispering._]</p> <p>Yes, but be careful what you say.</p>

<h4>POOR MAN</h4>. <p>[_Takes off his hat, approaches slowly to the railing, and speaks humbly._]</p> <p>Your honor. I--</p> <p>[_Swallows hard, clears throat._] Your honor, I've a little favor--to ask of you.</p>

<h4>JUDGE</h4>. <p>[_Looking coldly at the_ POOR MAN.] Well?</p>
You see, you
<h4>POOR MAN</h4>. <p>r honor, I've been poor all my life. I've never had much fun. I don't ask for a lot of money, but--I would like enough so that I could have some swell clothes, and--so that I could eat, drink, and be merry with the boys. You know, I just want to have a good time. Do you think you could fix it for me, Judge?</p>

<h4>JUDGE</h4>. <p>c So you just want to have a good time? Want me to take away your poverty? I suppose you have no moral weakness you want to change, no defects in your character that you want to better?</p>

<h4>POOR MAN</h4>. <p>[_Stammering and twirling his hat._]</p> <p>Why, w-hy, Judge, I--I am not a bad man. Of--of course, I have my faults, but then--I've never committed any crimes. I guess I stack up pretty fair as men go. I'm just awful tired of being poor and never having any fun. Couldn't you help me out on that point, Judge?</p>
