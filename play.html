    <h5>THE EXCHANGE
        BY
        ALTHEA THURSTON</h5>
POOR MAN. [_Indicating the_ JUDGE _with a motion of his head_.] Is that him?

IMP. [_Whispering loudly his reply._] Yes, that is his honor.

POOR MAN. [_Still whispering and showing signs of nervousness._] Do I dare speak to him?

IMP. [_Enjoying the situation and still whispering._] Yes, but be careful what you say.

POOR MAN. [_Takes off his hat, approaches slowly to the railing, and speaks humbly._] Your honor. I--[_Swallows hard, clears throat._] Your honor, I've a little favor--to ask of you.

JUDGE. [_Looking coldly at the_ POOR MAN.] Well?

POOR MAN. You see, your honor, I've been poor all my life. I've never had much fun. I don't ask for a lot of money, but--I would like enough so that I could have some swell clothes, and--so that I could eat, drink, and be merry with the boys. You know, I just want to have a good time. Do you think you could fix it for me, Judge?

JUDGE. [_Gazes at him sternly for a moment._] So you just want to have a good time? Want me to take away your poverty? I suppose you have no moral weakness you want to change, no defects in your character that you want to better?

POOR MAN. [_Stammering and twirling his hat._] Why, w-hy, Judge, I--I am not a bad man. Of--of course, I have my faults, but then--I've never committed any crimes. I guess I stack up pretty fair as men go. I'm just awful tired of being poor and never having any fun. Couldn't you help me out on that point, Judge?
