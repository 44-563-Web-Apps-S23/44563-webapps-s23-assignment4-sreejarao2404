You see, you</p>
<h4 class="POORMAN">POOR MAN</h4> <p class="speech"> honor, I've been poor all my life. I've never had much fun. I don't ask for a lot of money, but--I would like enough so that I could have some swell clothes, and--so that I could eat, drink, and be merry with the boys. You know, I just want to have a good time. Do you think you could fix it for me, Judge?</p>

<h4 class="JUDGE">JUDGE</h4> <p class="speech">c So you just want to have a good time? Want me to take away your poverty? I suppose you have no moral weakness you want to change, no defects in your character that you want to better?</p>

<h4 class="POORMAN">POOR MAN</h4> <p class="direction">[_Stammering and twirling his hat._]</p> <p class="speech">Why, w-hy, Judge, I--I am not a bad man. Of--of course, I have my faults, but then--I've never committed any crimes. I guess I stack up pretty fair as men go. I'm just awful tired of being poor and never having any fun. Couldn't you help me out on that point, Judge?</p>
